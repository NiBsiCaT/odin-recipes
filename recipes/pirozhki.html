    <h4>Description:</h4>

    <p> Pirozhki are Eastern European baked or fried yeast-leavened boat-shaped buns with a variety of
        fillings. Pirozhki are a popular street food and comfort food in Eastern Europe.</p>

    <p>A typical pirozhok is boat- or rarely crescent-shaped, made of yeast-leavened dough, with filling completely
        enclosed. Similar Russian pastries (pirogs) of other shapes include coulibiac, kalitka, rasstegai, and
        vatrushka. </p>
    <p>Pirozhki are either fried or baked. They come in sweet or savory varieties. Common savory fillings include ground
        meat, mashed potato, mushrooms, boiled egg with scallions, or cabbage. Typical sweet fillings are fruit (apple,
        cherry, apricot, lemon), jam, or tvorog.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>1 cup warm milk (110 degrees F)</li>

    </ul>

        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>1 large onion, finely diced</li>
        <li>2 pounds ground beef</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt, or more to taste</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dried dill weed</li>
        <li>⅓ cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>¼ cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese (Optional)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese (Optional)</li>
        <li>vegetable oil for frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Directions:</h4>

    <ol>

        <li>
            <strong>Step:</strong>
            <p> Combine 1 scant cup of warm milk and yeast in a bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook. Let sit
                until foamy and bubbly, about 10 minutes. Add sugar, salt, egg, butter, and almost all of the flour,
                holding back a small amount in case dough gets too dry. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Step:</strong>
            <p> Knead in the mixer until dough is soft and supple. Scrape dough onto your work surface. Grease the bowl
                with a few drops of oil and place dough back in. Cover bowl and let dough rise in a warm spot until
                doubled in volume, about 1 hour. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Step:</strong>
            <p> In the meantime, heat olive oil and butter in a pot over medium-high heat. Add onion, ground beef, and
                garlic. Season with kosher salt and black pepper. Cook beef, breaking apart with a wooden spoon, until
                no longer pink, 5 to 7 minutes. Continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until evenly browned, about 2
                minutes more. Remove from heat. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Step:</strong>
            <p> Stir dill into the beef mixture. Add chicken broth and stir, scraping up the browned bits from the
                bottom of the pan. Let mixture cool for 10 minutes. Stir in Cheddar cheese and Parmesan cheese. Let
                filling cool completely. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Step:</strong>
            <p> Transfer dough to a work surface. Press out air bubbles. Pinch off a piece of dough and form into a
                ball; press into a disc. Dust with a minimal amount of flour and roll into a circle about 1/8-inch thick
                and 5 to 6 inches in diameter. Dip your finger in water and dampen the edges of the circle. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Step:</strong>
            <p> Place dough circle in 1 hand and add a few tablespoons of the beef filling. Pinch edges together to
                seal. Place pirozhki on the table seam-side up and pinch off any excess dough; too much dough will make
                it hard to fry. Moisten the center of the seam with water. Fold the 2 ends inward and flip pirozhki
                over, seam-side down; press down lightly. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Step:</strong>
            <p> Form the remaining pirozhki and let them rest until dough rises slightly, 15 to 20 minutes. </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Step:</strong>
            <p> Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Fry pirozhki in batches,
                seam-side down, until golden brown, about 90 seconds. Flip and fry until browned on the other side,
                about 90 seconds more. Drain on paper towels and cool for a few minutes. </p>
        </li>

    </ol>
