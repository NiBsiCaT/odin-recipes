    <h4>Description:</h4>
    <p>Pasta salad, known in Italian as insalata di pasta or pasta fredda, is a salad dish prepared with one or more
        types of pasta, almost always chilled or room temperature, and most often tossed in a vinegar, oil, or
        mayonnaise-based dressing. It is typically served as an appetiser (antipasto) or first course (primo). Pasta
        salad is often regarded as a spring or summertime dish, but it can be served any time of year.</p>

    <p>The ingredients used vary widely by region, restaurant, seasonal availability, and personal preferences. The
        salad can be as simple as cold macaroni mixed with mayonnaise (a macaroni salad), or as elaborate as several
        pastas tossed together with a vinaigrette and a variety of fresh, preserved or cooked ingredients. These can
        include vegetables, legumes, cheeses, nuts, herbs, spices, meats, poultry, or seafood. Broccoli, carrot, baby
        corn, cucumber, olives, onion, beans, chick peas, peppers, and Parmesan or feta cheeses are all popular
        ingredients in versions typically found at North American salad bars. </p>
